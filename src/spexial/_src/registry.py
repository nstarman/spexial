"""The coverage registry: what upstream provides, and what `spexial` adds.

This is the central table of the library. Every function `spexial` exports has a
row here recording what `jax.scipy.special` and `scipy.special` provide, from
which version, and whether the upstream version is differentiable. The table
drives three decisions:

1. **Whether a function belongs in `spexial` at all.** A function upstream
   already covers everywhere we support is redundant.
2. **When to stop implementing it.** Once `spexial`'s own floor rises above a
   function's `jax_since`, the implementation can become a re-export, then be
   deprecated, then removed. `Status.REDUNDANT_ABOVE_FLOOR` marks the rows
   waiting on exactly that.
3. **Where a hand-written derivative is worth the code.** `custom_jvp` records
   where `spexial` defines an analytic derivative rather than letting JAX
   differentiate through a series.

The table is *checked*, not asserted: `tests/unit/test_registry.py` verifies
every `jax_*` field against the installed JAX, so a row cannot quietly go stale
when upstream adds a function. `docs/reference/coverage.md` is generated from
here by `scripts/gen_coverage_table.py`, and a test fails if it drifts.

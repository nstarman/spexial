r"""``spexial``: `scipy.special` in JAX.

``spexial`` implements special functions on top of JAX, so that they compose
with `jax.jit`, `jax.vmap` and `jax.grad`. Where a `scipy.special` counterpart
exists the name, call signature and return values follow it.

Two exports have **no** `scipy.special` counterpart:

- `polylog`, the polylogarithm :math:`\mathrm{Li}_n(z)` (compare `mpmath.polylog`).
- `eval_gegenbauers`, which returns the Gegenbauer polynomial of degree ``n``
  *and every lower degree*, as a by-product of the recurrence.

The remaining exports do have one, but are not always drop-in replacements --
`k0`/`k1`/`k2` are accurate to ~2e-7 rather than to machine precision, and
`comb` is the ``exact=False`` variant, so it returns a float that is only
close to the integer. Each docstring states its own domain and accuracy.

Examples
--------
>>> import spexial as sp
>>> round(float(sp.comb(5, 2)), 9)
10.0

`comb` is inexact, so the value is near 10 rather than exactly 10:

>>> float(sp.comb(5, 2)) == 10.0
False

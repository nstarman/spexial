# Why `spexial` exists alongside `jax.scipy.special`

A reasonable first question about this library is why it is a library at all, rather than a pull request to JAX. The honest answer is that most of it _should_ end up upstream, and the design assumes it will.

## What upstream can and cannot take

`jax.scipy.special` mirrors `scipy.special`. That constraint is deliberate and it is load-bearing: it is what lets a NumPy user move to JAX without relearning a namespace. It also decides what can go in.

Two of the functions here have **no `scipy.special` counterpart at all**. `polylog` is the general polylogarithm — `scipy` has only `spence`, the order-2 case at a shifted argument. `eval_gegenbauers` returns every order up to `n` from a single pass of the recurrence, which is a JAX-shaped idea rather than a SciPy one: it exists because computing degrees `0..n` separately repeats the same work `n` times, and because returning a stacked array is natural where returning `n + 1` scalars is not. Neither can be upstreamed into a namespace defined by mirroring SciPy without first changing what that namespace is for.

The rest could go upstream, and some of it should.

## The floor problem

`spexial` supports jax from 0.7.2. `jax.scipy.special.comb` arrived in 0.10.2.

Those two facts are the whole reason `comb` exists here. It is not better than JAX's; above 0.10.2 it is marginally slower. It exists so that code depending on `spexial` works on the versions `spexial` claims to support. A contribution to JAX, however good, does nothing for anyone pinned below the release it lands in — and scientific code is pinned below current releases most of the time.

This is a general shape, not a one-off: a function can be _upstream_ and still _unavailable_. The gap between "JAX has it" and "your environment has it" is measured in years for some projects.

## Becoming redundant on purpose

What makes this defensible rather than merely duplicative is that the redundancy is tracked and has an exit.

Every function carries a `Status` in the [coverage registry](../reference/coverage.md), and one of the values is `REDUNDANT_ABOVE_FLOOR` — meaning upstream covers it, but only above the version floor this package supports:

```pycon
>>> from spexial.registry import REGISTRY, Status
>>> [k for k, v in REGISTRY.items() if v.status is Status.REDUNDANT_ABOVE_FLOOR]
['comb']

```

The procedure for such a row is written down in `AGENTS.md`: when the floor rises to the version in `jax_since`, the implementation becomes a re-export; one release later it is deprecated; the release after that it is removed. Removal takes three releases, so nobody's code breaks on an upgrade.

The registry is checked against the _installed_ JAX on every test run, in both directions — a row claiming JAX lacks a function fails if JAX has it, and vice versa. That is what keeps this from rotting into a permanent shadow library: the moment upstream catches up, a test says so.

## Where it earns its place independently

Two functions here are not waiting for anything, because they do something upstream has chosen not to.

`spence` accepts complex arguments; `jax.scipy.special.spence` is real-only and raises. And JAX's gradient is `nan` across roughly $1 < z < 2$, where this one is exact. Those are different capabilities, not a different implementation of the same capability.

`zeta` extends JAX's Hurwitz zeta to the negative integers through the functional equation. JAX returns `nan` there. The extension is partial — the critical strip and negative non-integers are still `nan` — and the [accuracy page](../reference/accuracy-and-domains.md) says so rather than implying full coverage.

`gamma` is the interesting middle case. The value is JAX's, called directly, so it cannot drift. What `spexial` adds is an analytic derivative that keeps 3× less residual memory through the backward pass at parity on time. That is a real benefit and a narrow one, and the registry records it as `DELEGATES` — a row that earns its place on the cost columns alone, and becomes redundant the moment upstream's own gradient matches on both.

## The honest summary

This library is three things at once, and it is worth being clear about which part is which:

1. **A staging area** for functions that belong upstream but are not there yet, or are there only above a floor real users have not reached. `comb` today; more of the Bessel functions eventually.
2. **A home for things that do not fit the `scipy.special` mirror** — `polylog` and `eval_gegenbauers`.
3. **A small set of genuine improvements** — complex `spence`, negative `zeta`, cheaper gradients — that exist because a focused package can make choices a general one cannot.

Only the second category is permanent. The first is designed to shrink, and the registry exists to make sure someone notices when it should.
